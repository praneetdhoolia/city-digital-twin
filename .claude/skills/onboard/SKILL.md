description: Start-of-session onboarding — rebuild the complete project picture from the repo and GitHub (goals, phases, tasks, simulator-vs-reality, issues, PRs), verify the environment, and state the active lane. Use at the start of any session, especially with no prior context. The counterpart of /handoff.

# /onboard — reconstruct the whole picture from `main` alone

Assume zero session memory. Everything below is read from the repository and
GitHub; nothing is taken from recollection. Where a document disagrees with
another, the precedence is: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (constraints) →
`DECISIONS.md` (record) → `STATUS.md` (board) → `NEXT_AGENT_BRIEF.md`
(pointer). **Trust order: artefact > document > brief.** The brief says this
about itself — verify anything load-bearing against the artefact it cites.

Run the phases in order. The output of this skill is a briefing to the user
(Phase 6) — do not start work the brief assigns until the briefing is given
and the environment checks pass.

Throughout, `<city>` is the active city — `CITYSIM_CITY`, default
`newcastle` — per the framework rule that nothing city-specific is assumed.

## Phase 0 — The reading, in order

1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — conventions and hard constraints (loaded
   automatically; re-read the hard-constraints list deliberately).
2. `cities/<city>/docs/handover/NEXT_AGENT_BRIEF.md` — the handover:
   goal, done-do-not-redo, active lane, traps, standing directives.
3. `cities/<city>/docs/STATUS.md` — the board: phase table, deliverable
   checklist, numbered plan, runs on disk, run economics.
4. `cities/<city>/docs/DECISIONS.md` — start at its topical index ("How
   to find something in this file"); read the sections the brief and board
   point at (the newest §9.x family and the top of the §14 change log).
5. `cities/<city>/docs/design/newcastle-lr-proposal.md` §1, §3, §7, §8 —
   the research goal, hypotheses A1–A6/B1–B4, phases, deliverables.
6. Only as needed after that: the audit reports under
   `cities/<city>/docs/audit/` and design dossiers under `docs/design/`.

## Phase 1 — Environment verification (the brief's §0, always)

```bash
python src/setup/bootstrap_toolchain.py --verify   # pins + compiles the Java
python tests/check_manifest.py                     # committed subset intact
python src/registry/check_hardcoding.py --strict   # must exit 0
```

Also: `git status` / current branch (work starts from `main` unless the
brief says otherwise); confirm whether a run is in progress (MATSim java
process, `results/` mtimes) before assuming the machine is free.

## Phase 2 — The live state from GitHub, not from documents

1. `gh issue list --state open` — for each open issue: title, last comment
   date, whether its numbers predate the latest DECISIONS entry (if so it
   needs updating, which is /handoff work to flag, not silently absorb).
2. `gh pr list --state all` — the merged sequence tells the project's story;
   any OPEN PR is unfinished business to surface before new work starts.
3. Cross-check: does the brief's issue/PR ledger match what GitHub actually
   shows? A mismatch is a finding — report it, do not paper over it.

## Phase 3 — The six state-of-the-project questions

Answer all six exhaustively, every number traceable to its source:

1. **Goals & achievement.** The research goal (proposal §1: the untested
   Auditor-General claims; hypotheses A1–A6, B1–B4, secondary S-a–S-d) and
   the operational goal (brief §1: the digital twin, "CHECKED, not
   assumed"). Against them: what is built, what is *measured* to work, and
   the state of each of the six project deliverables (proposal §8).
2. **Phases.** P0–P7 with each one's state and the evidence for it
   (STATUS.md phase table, verified against the artefacts it cites).
3. **Tasks per phase.** The numbered plan (STATUS.md "The plan"): per batch,
   how many done, how many done *and evaluated* (a task without its
   measurement is not evaluated), which are open, which is the active lane,
   which are proposed for deletion/rework and awaiting a decision.
4. **Simulator vs real life.** The latest valid run's fit against the
   calibration targets: per-mode modelled/observed/error, occupancy,
   trip-geometry ratios, counts, patronage — labelled pre- or
   post-calibration, diagnostics or results. If no run exists, say so;
   never infer results from inputs.
5. **Issue ledger.** Totals filed/closed/open; per open issue: what it
   tracks, its last evidence date, and whether it needs evaluation,
   updating, or is queued work.
6. **PR history and the next PR.** One line per merged PR; what the next PR
   should achieve per the recorded value order, and whether that choice is
   pending a decision.

## Phase 4 — The constraints that invalidate work (recite, don't rediscover)

From CLAUDE.md and the brief, confirm you can state without looking: no
multi-hour run without explicit approval (say the cost, get a yes); no
invented data; the 67/143 holdout split is never opened or peeked; never
compare across sample fractions or network builds; one arm at a time; raw
data immutable; every assumed value declared in the registry with a sweep;
run outputs need `_run.json` to be results; branch naming and
no-attribution rules. Then read the brief's traps section — each one has
already cost a day.

## Phase 5 — Gap scan

- Board lines contradicted by artefacts (stale figures, wrong counts).
- Uncommitted work in the tree that no document mentions.
- An in-progress or crashed run nobody closed out.
- Open issues whose numbers are older than the newest DECISIONS entry.
- An open PR that should merge or close before new work.

Each gap goes in the briefing; fixing them is scoped work, not something to
do silently during onboarding.

## Phase 6 — The briefing (the deliverable)

Report to the user, in this order and with numbers:
1. The six answers from Phase 3, compressed but complete.
2. Environment check results (Phase 1) and anything they block.
3. Gaps found (Phase 5).
4. **The active lane** — the single next task per the brief, its cost, and
   whether it needs a decision or approval before starting.

Then stop. Do not begin the active lane until the user (or a standing
directive in the brief) says to.
