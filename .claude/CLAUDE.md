# city-digital-twin — project conventions

Repo-level guidance for any Claude Code session working in this repository.
This file lives in `.claude/`, which Claude Code loads automatically. The repo
root holds exactly one document: [`README.md`](../README.md), the usage guide.

## What this is

A counterfactual microsimulation of the **Newcastle Light Rail** as a transport
intervention — MATSim end to end (SUMO descoped 25 Aug 2026, DECISIONS.md §9.74) — built to be
more transparent about its assumptions than the business case it examines.

- [`docs/design/newcastle-lr-proposal.md`](../cities/newcastle/docs/design/newcastle-lr-proposal.md) is the **research design**: what
  is being built, which scenarios, which tests. Read it for intent, scope and vocabulary.
- **[`DECISIONS.md`](../cities/newcastle/docs/DECISIONS.md) is the single source of truth for every value that is
  not observed.** Every parameter chosen without direct empirical support is recorded
  there with its rationale and its sweep range (proposal §8.1 — *"not optional"*). It also
  records four corrections to premises stated in the proposal. **Consult it before
  changing any assumed value, and don't re-litigate a settled decision without new
  evidence.**
- **[`STATUS.md`](../cities/newcastle/docs/STATUS.md) is the single source of truth for where the build is, what's
  next, and how to resume.** Read it at session start; **keep it current in the same
  commit/PR as the work it describes.** It is a **board, not a diary** — 944 lines of
  dated narrative were moved out of it to
  [`docs/handover/SESSION_LOG.md`](../cities/newcastle/docs/handover/SESSION_LOG.md); do not append more.
- [`README.md`](../README.md) is the **usage guide**: install, run a scenario with
  `run.py`, reproduce the data package. It is the only document at the repo root;
  every other one is under [`docs/`](../docs/README.md).
- Current stage: **P3 demand synthesis complete. No scenario has been run. Nothing in
  the repo is a result.** The MATSim network, the 15 mapped schedules,
  the synthetic population, the activity chains and the 30 assembled scenario x day-type
  run input sets are all *inputs*, not outputs.

## Working style (apply to every change)

1. **Inventory first.** Read the relevant files; state your understanding; flag
   contradictions, gaps and decisions.
2. **Plan, then get sign-off.** Propose the change and **wait for approval** before
   writing files.
3. **Implement.** Only after approval. Prefer clear TODOs over speculative
   implementation.

## Hard constraints (do not violate)

- **`config/schema/` is portable; `cities/<city>/` is one city's everything.**
  **Nothing city-specific belongs outside `cities/<city>/`** - not a value, not an
  acquisition adapter, not a coordinate, not a data file. The framework
  (`src/`, `config/schema/`, `tests/`, `run.py`) must read identically for a city it
  has never seen. `src/city.py` is the ONLY module that knows where a city lives;
  everything else asks it. Paths inside a city are recorded CITY-RELATIVE
  (`data/processed/...`), so one manifest row means the same thing in every city.
  That split is the point of the naming: a field key like `A.road.speed_default` is
  generic, but 50 km/h residential, 16.96 AUD/h and a 0.50 bicycle ownership rate are
  Newcastle's. The city is selected by `CITYSIM_CITY` (default `newcastle`) — an env prefix that is itself a suburb name awaiting rename; see *Naming* under Conventions. **Never
  put a place name, a coordinate or a hand-drawn extent in a script** — derive it from
  a boundary or a tag that any city also has, and if it genuinely must be declared, it
  belongs under `cities/<city>/registry/`. A typed-in rectangle cannot be wrong in a
  way anyone notices: the OSM harvest box in `cities/<city>/extract/overpass.py` clipped **87 of
  1,500 core SA1s** out of the road network and nobody saw it for three phases.
- **Every controllable value is declared in `cities/<city>/registry/`, not typed into a
  script.** A value whose `source` is `assumed`, `literature`, `measured` or `derived`
  must carry a sweep, a `held_fixed` rule or a `derived_from` identity — the schema
  rejects anything else, and `check_package.py` tests it. Regenerate
  [`docs/reference/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`](../cities/newcastle/docs/reference/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md)
  (`python src/registry/render_docs.py`) in the same change. The build layer is not yet
  migrated and is pinned to the registry by `src/registry/check_legacy_drift.py`: if you
  change a constant there, change the registry field with it.
- **No invented data.** Never fabricate an observation, a count, a patronage figure or a
  coefficient. If a value is not measured it is **assumed or modelled**, and it must be
  labelled as such in the `source` field of its artefact **and** recorded in
  `DECISIONS.md` with a rationale and a sweep range. An unsupported number presented as
  observed is the one failure this project cannot absorb.
- **No result before a run.** Nothing in this repo is an output of the model until a
  scenario has actually been executed. Do not write, summarise or infer scenario results
  from the input package.
- **Reproducibility is a gate, not an aspiration.** Every derived file must be
  regenerable by a committed script from the immutable raw downloads, and must be listed
  in [`data/MANIFEST.csv`](../cities/newcastle/data/MANIFEST.csv) with its hash, row count, producing script,
  source, licence and retrieval date. Regenerate the manifest
  (`python src/build/build_manifest.py`) whenever a data artefact changes.
- **Determinism.** Everything synthetic is seeded (`20260810`). Do not introduce
  unseeded randomness, wall-clock dependence or dict/set-ordering dependence into a build
  script.
- **Provenance for every acquisition.** A new download lands under `data/raw/` with a
  `provenance_*.json` recording source URL, retrieval timestamp and licence. Raw
  downloads are **immutable** — never edit one in place; corrections happen in
  `cities/<city>/extract` / `src/build`.
- **Licence boundary.** OSM-derived layers are **ODbL 1.0 (share-alike)**; the rest of
  the package is CC-BY 4.0. Keep the distinction visible in the manifest and in anything
  published; do not merge an OSM-derived column into a CC-BY artefact without noting it.
- **The three unobtained inputs stay unobtained.** SCATS signal phasing, journey-linked
  Opal, and measured charging dwell are handled **by sweep, not by
  assumption-as-fact** (`DECISIONS.md` §0, §13). Do not quietly pin one to a point value.
- **The toolchain is pinned, and a toolchain change is a model change.** The JDK,
  pt2matsim, Maven and the MATSim signals run stack are fetched by [`src/setup/bootstrap_toolchain.py`](../src/setup/bootstrap_toolchain.py)
  into `.tools/` (gitignored) and pinned by sha256 in `.tools/toolchain.json`. Changing a
  version means re-running, re-hashing and logging it in `DECISIONS.md` §14 — a different
  jar can move a result.
- **One build of the network per comparison.** pt2matsim's schedule mapping is not
  reproducible run to run (`DECISIONS.md` §3.5): ~18% of route link sequences differ
  between identical builds, while stop-to-link assignment is stable. Never compare a
  scenario mapped in one build against a scenario mapped in another. **Anything that
  needs a per-day-type or per-variant schedule must derive it from the already-mapped
  schedule** (as `build_matsim_run_inputs.py` does, by filtering `transitRoute` ids),
  never by re-running the mapper.
- **A scenario runs on its own mapped network, not on `networks/matsim/variants/`.**
  The variant networks are patched over the *base* network, which carries no mapped
  transit links; they are a reference artefact showing the E1 deltas. The runnable
  network is the scenario's own `schedules/<S>/network.xml.gz` with the E1 patch
  re-applied by `osm:way:id` (`DECISIONS.md` §9.3).
- **Bulk data is not committed.** See [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore) — raw downloads, GTFS
  bundles, synthetic population/plans, large derived geometry and run outputs are
  regenerable and stay out of git. The manifest is committed; the bytes are not.
- **Units and CRS.** EPSG:28356 (**GDA94** / MGA Zone 56 — GDA2020 is EPSG:7856; the
  label was wrong repo-wide and is corrected in `DECISIONS.md` §2.6, the projection
  itself is unchanged), metres, base year 2026. State
  units in every new column name or data-dictionary entry.
- **Language:** Australian / Indian English spellings throughout.

## Conventions

- **Naming: the project is Newcastle, not Wickham.** The modelled city is the
  **Newcastle (NSW) region** — five LGAs, 1,500 core SA1s. **Wickham is one
  suburb of it**, and the name is legitimate in exactly three places: the
  suburb's own zones and stops, **Newcastle Interchange at Wickham** (the
  transfer `beta_transfer_penalty_min` prices), and **S1, the bus-shuttle
  scenario** that starts there. Anywhere else it is a stale project codename —
  the repo and the framework are `city-digital-twin` (renamed from
  the earlier Newcastle-specific repository name, 24 Aug 2026) and the city registry is `newcastle`.
  Naming the whole project after one suburb also contradicts the hard constraint
  directly below: **no place name belongs in the framework**, only in
  `cities/<city>/`. Two codename identifiers survive in code and are
  tracked for rename — the `CITYSIM_*` environment prefix and the
  `src/java/citysim/` package (see the open naming issue). Do not add more, and
  do not rename a genuine Wickham-the-suburb reference.
- **Branch naming.** `<git-handle>/<short-kebab-description>`, with `<git-handle>` derived
  from the active git identity (the `…+<handle>@users.noreply.github.com` email, else
  `git config user.name`). **Never `claude/*`** — if the harness assigns one, this rule
  wins: `git branch -m …` before committing. A SessionStart hook surfaces this each
  session.
- **NEVER commit directly to `main` — every change, including a docs-only
  close-out, lands via a pull request** (project rule, 21 Aug 2026; it
  supersedes the earlier "docs-only close-outs land directly on `main`"
  convention). Work on `<git-handle>/<kebab>` branches and merge through a
  PR, with no exception for size or urgency. The repository's root commit
  (`ba95e7a`) is the single structural exception — a root cannot arrive by
  PR. Direct commits made before this rule stay in history as they are
  (decision, 21 Aug 2026 — do not rewrite `main`).
- **The session's PR is opened at `/handoff`, not when a piece of work
  finishes** (project rule, 21 Aug 2026). During a session, work accumulates
  as commits on the session branch; `/handoff` closes the session out and
  opens ONE pull request carrying it. After opening the PR, the agent
  **arms a watch for the merge**: when the PR merges and the remote branch
  is deleted, the agent deletes the local branch — **only then is the
  handoff complete**. If the session ends before the merge, the open PR is
  the next session's first item of unfinished business (`/onboard` surfaces
  it).
- **Pull requests target `main` only — never another work branch.** A PR is
  opened when the work is ready to merge into `main`, not before, and never
  stacked on an unmerged branch: merging a stacked PR lands it on its *base
  branch*, not `main` (measured 20 Aug 2026 — five of six stacked PRs never
  reached `main` until PR #56 carried the union across). Sequentially
  dependent work stays as commits on one branch until the prior PR merges,
  or ships in the same PR. **Issue and PR titles follow one scheme**:
  `P<phase>: <concise plain-English summary>` (≤~72 chars), task numbers or
  issue cross-refs in parens at the end — never internal idiom ("Directive:", "Audit …:", "handover:", "board:", "Tooling:") and never
  DECISIONS §-refs in a title. PR bodies follow conventional large-project
  GitHub style (Summary / Changes / Testing / Breaking changes; neutral
  voice — the internal idiom of `DECISIONS.md` stays out of GitHub
  artefacts).
- **Attribution.** No Claude co-author trailer or PR attribution
  (`attribution.commit`/`pr` empty, `includeCoAuthoredBy: false` in
  [`.claude/settings.json`](settings.json)); a SessionStart hook pins the git
  identity. **No `claude.ai/code` session link** in commit messages or PR bodies either.
  `attribution.sessionUrl: false` is set, but it does **not** suppress the session-link
  footer the cloud platform injects into a PR body — so this is enforced
  deterministically across four layers, not by that setting alone:
  1. [`.githooks/commit-msg`](../.githooks/commit-msg) strips the session link /
     `Claude-Session:` trailer from every commit (activated each session via
     `core.hooksPath`, set in the SessionStart hook because an ephemeral container
     doesn't track `.git/hooks`);
  2. [`.claude/hooks/block-session-ref-in-pr.sh`](hooks/block-session-ref-in-pr.sh)
     (`PreToolUse`) denies `create`/`update_pull_request` MCP calls whose title/body carry
     the link;
  3. [`.claude/hooks/block-session-ref-in-gh-pr.sh`](hooks/block-session-ref-in-gh-pr.sh)
     (`PreToolUse`) denies `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit` commands carrying it (the `gh` CLI
     path);
  4. [`.github/workflows/strip-session-ref.yml`](../.github/workflows/strip-session-ref.yml)
     scrubs the link from a PR **body** server-side — the only layer that catches a body
     injected by the cloud **platform** (outside the agent's tool loop, and not in git
     history, so layers 1–3 structurally cannot see it). It is a scrub-after-creation.
- **Network access** is sandboxed to the data sources this project actually uses
  (ABS, TfNSW Open Data, Overpass, Copernicus, GitHub) — see `sandbox.network` in
  `.claude/settings.json`. Adding a source means adding its domain there **and** a
  provenance record.
- **Path references in prose.** Never abbreviate a file path with `…`/`...` (e.g.
  `data/.../A1_road_edges.csv`). Renderers auto-link it into a literal, broken URL. Write
  the full real path — `data/processed/network/A1_road_edges.csv`.
- **Commit messages** state what changed in the *model or the data*, not which script ran.

## Checks

| Check | Where | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `python tests/check_manifest.py` | CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) + local | committed files only |
| `python -m compileall -q src tests` | CI | nothing |
| JSON validity of provenance / scenario / params files | CI | nothing |
| `python src/registry/check_hardcoding.py` | local, **before every commit** | committed files only |
| `python tests/check_package.py` | **local only** | the full ~2.3 GiB package |

**`check_hardcoding.py` is the ledger for the rule above it: every value declared,
nothing decided in a script.** It reports declared-but-unwired fields, config
template literals, numeric constants in the build layer, and coordinates typed
into code. It reports rather than fails by default — the count is currently **95**
and is worked down, not silenced. `--strict` exits 1 and is the eventual gate.
**If your change adds an item, the change is not finished.**

CI deliberately runs nothing that downloads a source dataset or executes a scenario:
those depend on ABS/TfNSW/Overpass availability and on compute, not on the diff. Run
`tests/check_package.py` on a workstation before declaring a data phase complete.

## Repo map

| Path | What it holds |
|------|---------------|
| `README.md` | **The only document at the repo root.** Usage guide: install, run a scenario, reproduce the package. |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | This file — conventions and hard constraints. Loaded automatically each session. |
| `cities/<city>/docs/STATUS.md` | **That city's board** — phase state, deliverable checklist, next action. Read at session start; keep current. **Not a diary**: narrative goes in `DECISIONS.md`. |
| `cities/<city>/docs/DECISIONS.md` | Every assumed/modelled value + rationale + sweep range (don't re-litigate). **Start at its "How to find something in this file" index** — the section numbers are not in file order and §9 holds unrelated topics. |
| `docs/` | **The FRAMEWORK's documentation only**, indexed by [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md). A city's own study documents live under `cities/<city>/docs/`. |
| `config/schema/` | **The portable half.** What any city must supply and in what shape: the field and registry schemas, the overlay schema and the output schemas. **No city's values live here.** |
| `run.py` | The front door: run a scenario with defaults or custom arguments. |
| `src/city.py` | Resolves which city's inputs a run reads. The only module that knows. |
| `cities/<city>/` | **ONE CITY - everything specific to it.** Selected by `CITYSIM_CITY` (default `newcastle`). |
| `cities/<city>/docs/` | That city's study: `STATUS.md` (board), `DECISIONS.md` (every unobserved value), `design/`, `audit/`, `handover/`, and the GENERATED `reference/`. |
| `cities/<city>/build/` | Builders that encode that city's intervention, corridor, history and statistical geography. |
| `cities/<city>/geometry/` | Declared extents that were once typed into scripts. |
| `cities/<city>/registry/` | That city's declared values, with units, provenance and a sweep or held-fixed rule. |
| `cities/<city>/overlays/` | `scenarios/`, `day/` and `runs/` value overlays, in resolution order. |
| `cities/<city>/extract/` | That city's acquisition adapters — for Newcastle, ABS / TfNSW / Overpass. **Jurisdiction-specific by nature.** |
| `cities/<city>/data/raw/` | Immutable downloads + `provenance_*.json`. Never edited in place. |
| `cities/<city>/data/processed/` | Clipped and derived layers: zones, census, hts, observed, network, corridor, landuse, validation. |
| `cities/<city>/data/MANIFEST.csv` / `.json` | Per-file hash, rows, producing script, source, licence, retrieval date. **Paths are city-relative.** |
| `cities/<city>/networks/osm/` | Raw Overpass extracts (roads, footways, rail, parking, POI, buildings). |
| `cities/<city>/schedules/` | GTFS era feeds + `scenarios/S0..S6` variants. |
| `cities/<city>/demand/` | Synthetic `population/` (B1) and `plans/` (B2 tours per day type + `matsim/` plans). Seeded, deterministic. |
| `cities/<city>/params/` | C1 behavioural parameters + the sensitivity sweep grid. |
| `cities/<city>/scenarios/` | E1 scenario configs, one JSON per scenario, plus `matsim/` — the assembled run inputs, one directory per scenario x day type. |
| `src/build/` | Layer construction (the reproduction pipeline, in README order). |
| `src/registry/` | The registry resolver, its validators, the legacy-drift check and the docs generator. |
| `src/run/`, `src/calibrate/`, `src/analyse/` | P3+ execution, calibration and analysis. |
| `results/` | Run outputs. Gitignored — nothing here is committed. |
| `tests/` | `check_manifest.py` (CI, committed subset) and `check_package.py` (local, full package). |
