"""Overpass harvester for the study area, on an extent DERIVED from the package.

Both extents used to be typed rectangles. The study one did not cover the study
area: it cut 0.30 degrees off the west and 0.26 off the east of the five
declared LGAs, leaving **87 of 1,500 core SA1s and 31,940 agents - 5.2% of the
population - outside the road network**, where they made 3.2x longer trips and
cycled at 36.5% against 14.8%. It survived three phases, because a typed
rectangle cannot be wrong in a way anyone notices (issue #32).

So neither is typed now:

  STUDY      the dissolved LGA boundary from data/processed/zones/zones_LGA.gpkg,
             plus A.osm.harvest_margin_m.
  BUILDINGS  the observed light rail STOP SET from the GTFS-derived
             A3_stop_extras.csv, plus A.osm.buildings_margin_m. The stops are
             observed, they exist before any OSM harvest, and every city with a
             corridor has them. At the declared margin this extent CONTAINS the
             rectangle it replaced, so no building previously harvested is lost
             (issue #34).

Both inputs are produced from raw downloads that do not depend on OSM, so a cold
start still works: ABS boundaries for the first, the GTFS feed for the second.

**Tiled.** The corrected study extent is 2.02x the rectangle it replaced, and a
single Overpass query over it returns 504 Gateway Timeout - measured, twice, on
the roads layer. Each layer is therefore fetched over a grid of tiles no larger
than A.osm.harvest_tile_deg on a side and merged, de-duplicating elements by id:
Overpass returns a whole way when any part of it matches, so a way crossing a
tile boundary arrives in both.
