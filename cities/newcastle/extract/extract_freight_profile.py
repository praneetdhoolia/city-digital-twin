"""Measure the heavy-vehicle temporal profile from the classified hourly counts.

The freight background layer (issue #24, DECISIONS.md 9.49) needs two temporal
facts: WHEN heavy vehicles move within a day, and HOW MUCH lighter weekend
freight is than weekday freight. Both are MEASURED here rather than assumed -
the RMS permanent hourly counts carry a HEAVY VEHICLES classification, and the
study slice holds classified rows for stations inside the study area.

Outputs, both consumed by ``src/build/build_activity_chains.py``:

* ``data/processed/observed/freight_hourly_profile.csv`` -
  ``day_type,hour,share``: the share of a day's heavy volume departing in each
  hour, per day type. Shares sum to 1 within a day type.
* ``data/processed/observed/freight_day_factors.csv`` -
  ``day_type,factor,stations,station_days``: heavy daily volume relative to the
  same station's weekday mean (WEEKDAY = 1.0 by identity). The factor is the
  median across stations of each station's own SAT/SUN-to-weekday ratio, so a
  station that counts more days does not dominate the level.

Selection rules, all definitional rather than tuned:

* HEAVY VEHICLES classification only, resolved through the
  ``classification_seq -> classification_type`` pairing observed in the AADT
  slice - the hourly file carries only the code.
* Stations restricted to the study slice (``traffic_count_stations_newcastle``).
* Public holidays excluded: the model's day types are typical WEEKDAY/SAT/SUN
  and a public-holiday Monday is none of them.
* Only complete days are used: rows whose 24 hourly cells sum to their own
  ``daily_total`` (blank hourly cells are zero counts in this format; a row
  whose hours do not reconcile is a partial day).
* No year filter: every classified year in the raw download contributes. A
  cutoff would be an undeclared modelling choice; the profile is a SHAPE, and
  the volume it scales is declared and swept elsewhere
  (``B.freight.trip_ratio``).

Deterministic: pure aggregation of a hashed raw download, no randomness.
