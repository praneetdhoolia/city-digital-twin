# Convergence pilot evaluation — issue #5, first post-rebuild measurements

> **FROZEN RECORD — an 18 August 2026 measurement on a model that no longer exists (family F1).** Kept as evidence, never edited. The current position is in [`positions/`](../../positions).

*18 August 2026; the #5 verdict updated the same day when the declaration
landed. Two arms complete on the 16 August rebuild; the third was cancelled.
Claim → measurement → verdict, per the `ISSUE_VERDICTS.md` pattern. Nothing here
is a result about Newcastle: both runs are uncalibrated, so every figure below is
a statement about the run, not about the city.*

> **Superseded in one place, and only one.** The relaxation section below is
> kept as the record of what was measured, but its verdict is closed and its
> "complete within 10 iterations" reading was too coarse — the snap is **one
> iteration** wide. `DECISIONS.md` §9.43 is authoritative for both. Every
> structural finding in the slate further down stands unchanged.

## What was run

| | arm 1 | arm 2 | arm 3 (CANCELLED) |
|---|---|---|---|
| tag | `conv1000_10pct` | `conv1000_25pct` | `conv1500_10pct` |
| fraction × iterations | 10% × 1000 | 25% × 1000 | 10% × 1500 |
| agents | 54,617 | 136,068 | — |
| wall clock | 10 h 59 m | 30 h 47 m | stopped by instruction |
| median iteration | 33.3 s | 90.2 s | — |
| exit / accounting / telemetry | 0 / closes / clean | 0 / closes / clean | — |
| stuck agents | 0.022% of departures | 0.023% | — |

Arm 3 was stopped for compute economy after the two completed arms had cost 42
hours; its remains are quarantined in `results/_aborted_20260816/`. **Do not
relaunch it** — the trade it represents is recorded in `DECISIONS.md` §9.43 as
declared uncertainty on the pre-cutoff creep.

One arm at a time, threads 10 (registry), seed 20260810, same network build.
Two earlier directories from a concurrent 2 AM launch on 16 August died without
`_run.json` and were quarantined to `results/_aborted_20260816/`.

## The relaxation verdict (#5) — measured, and now DECLARED

**Claim (shipped):** ~1000 iterations suffice (`DECISIONS.md` §9.27, pre-rebuild).

**Measurement:** by the declared metric (per-mode drift, iteration 800 → 1000,
tolerance `RUN.relaxation.drift_tolerance_pp` = 0.5 pp) **both arms fail
identically**: worst-mode drift +3.54 pp (10%) and +3.60 pp (25%), car in both.

The drift decomposes into two phenomena the metric cannot distinguish:

1. **A selection snap at the cutoff.** Measured here on the 10-iteration grid
   as 800 → 810: car +3.4 pp, walk 3.97 → 1.02%, pt 1.08 → 0.25% at both
   fractions to within 0.1 pp. When innovation stops, exploration noise vanishes
   and selection concentrates agents onto their best-scoring plans. This is a
   property of the scoring structure, not of non-relaxation — **a run of any
   length fails the 800-vs-final window while the snap exists.**
   **Corrected by the per-iteration trace (§9.43): the snap is ONE iteration
   wide, not ten.** All of it lands in iteration 801 — car +3.256 pp (10%) and
   +3.380 pp (25%) — and iteration 802 onward moves by hundredths. The
   10-iteration reading here was an artefact of the output grid, and it matters
   because it sets the floor of the settle-margin sweep.
2. **True post-snap drift, well inside tolerance:** 810/850 → 1000 moves car
   +0.09 pp (10%) and +0.17 pp (25%).

**What is genuinely unconverged is the pre-cutoff search.** Car creep per 100
iterations at 25%: +1.94, +1.43, +1.04, +0.76 (iterations 400→800), a geometric
decay of ×0.73 per block; the 10% arm shows the same +0.75 at 700→800.
Extrapolated, ~2 pp of movement remained in the innovated state when the cutoff
froze it.

**Verdict: CLOSED — `RUN.controler.last_iteration` declared at 1000**
(`DECISIONS.md` §9.43, issue #5). Arm 3 was cancelled rather than run, so the
extrapolation above was never measured directly; it is carried as **declared
uncertainty** instead. The drift window was redefined in the same change —
`RUN.relaxation.settle_margin_iterations` = 10 — because the old instrument
could never pass at any horizon. At the new window both arms settle: worst-mode
drift **+0.22 pp** (10%) and **+0.17 pp** (25%) over iterations 810 → 1000,
inside the 0.5 pp tolerance but **outside the 0.1 pp floor of that tolerance's
own sweep**. What is declared is that the model RELAXES by 1000; what is *not*
established is that 1000 iterations of SEARCH suffice.

**Fraction-independence is established:** snap size, post-snap drift, creep
decay, stuck-agent profile and every structural finding below replicate at both
fractions. The 10% arm is a valid convergence probe for 25% conclusions.

## The evaluation slate on the two arms

| Claim | Measurement | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Mode share near HTS after the five demand fixes | `target_lga_pct`, linked: MAE **8.45 pp** (10%) / **6.95 pp** (25%). Car −5.0/−1.2, ride +20.3/+16.6, walk −12.7/−12.7, pt −3.5/−3.4, other +0.8/+0.8 | Structure right for car/bike/other; ride, walk, pt carry the calibration load (#9, #14). 25% fits better on the car/ride margin |
| #28: ride ≤ car realised speed per distance bin | Ride faster in **every bin below 50 km** at both fractions: 1.13–1.14× (0–1 km) declining to 1.01–1.02× (20–50 km). Aggregate means show parity (45.3 vs 45.2 km/h) — Simpson's reversal from ride's shorter trip mix | **Residual sized, #28 stays open.** Aggregate-mean comparisons remain banned |
| #31 occupancy constraint | 0.76 (10%) / 0.64 (25%) passengers per driver vs observed 0.35, range [0.25, 0.39] | Outside at both fractions; the #31 decision is live for the calibration sitting |
| #30 reopen: sub-1 km trip mass | 2.56% (10%) / 2.50% (25%) of completed trips vs HTS-implied >~10%. Destinations are fixed at generation, so this is generation-side | **Reopen condition met** — fraction-independent, structural |
| #29 sizing: bike share | 4.01/4.00% vs 3.2 observed | Availability 0.50 draw approximately right; **no constraint tuning warranted** |
| #20 reopen: V113 (M1 at Wyee) materially non-zero | Modelled 60 (10%, scaled) vs 44,885 observed light-vehicle; the through tier holds 17,955 agents with M1 its largest gate | **Reopen condition met** — through demand exists but does not traverse the count link; injection-point/routing question |
| Count fit sizes freight's absence (#24) | Mean −92% at both fractions, RMSE ~113% of mean observed, same 7 zero stations. Freight explains ~6.5%. The two stations on roads with no parallel alternative fit at −31% and −6%; urban arterials sit at −95 to −100%, including two matched within 6 m carrying zero | **The gap is structural, not freight-sized.** Working hypothesis: flat road hierarchy (no junction delay off-corridor; residential 50 vs arterial 60 km/h) disperses traffic off arterials. Needs verification before any remedy is proposed |
| Stuck-agent panel | 149 (10%) / 387 (25%) per iteration, walk+pt dominated; pre-rebuild was ~1,500 | Halved by the rebuild, persists at small scale; pt-stuck ≈ pt en route at the 30:00 window end |
| Wall-clock + heap re-derivation | 33.3 s/iter, ~29 GiB WS @ 10% (30g); 90.2 s/iter, ~33–38 GiB @ 25% (40g). One unexplained slow block (iterations ~200–293 at 25%, ~179 s/iter apparent, self-recovered — consistent with the §9.36-era stall, still unattributed) | Memory model: ~24 GiB fixed + ~0.09–0.3 MB/agent → 100% ≈ 80–160 GiB heap. 25% × 1000 costs ~31 h on the 2-channel laptop |

**Cross-fraction scaling (goal check):** walk, pt and bike+other shares match
across fractions to 0.1 pp; the car↔ride margin shifts ~3.7 pp (car 54.0 → 57.8,
ride 40.9 → 37.2 from 10% to 25%). Fraction scaling is clean for the minor modes
and **not neutral on the car/ride split** — to be re-examined once the ride
scoring defect is fixed, since that margin is currently dominated by it.

## Not done here, deliberately

**Done since, in the #5 declaration** (`DECISIONS.md` §9.43): the registry field
moved off `unobtained`, the drift window was redefined, and issue #5 closed.
Both arms were re-summarised against the new window and now report `relaxed:
true`; their `_summary.json` carries `snap_pp`, `drift_pp` and
`cutoff_to_final_pp`, the last reproducing the +3.54 / +3.60 figures above
exactly.

**Still not done here, and still deliberate.** No other issue is closed or
reopened on this evidence — #20, #28, #30 and #31 have their conditions met and
their actions belong with the ride sitting, not with a convergence measurement.
`fit.py` outputs live in each run directory (`_fit.json`); **no calibration
report has been written into `docs/archived/audit/`, because both arms remain
uncalibrated** and a settled run is still not a calibrated one.
