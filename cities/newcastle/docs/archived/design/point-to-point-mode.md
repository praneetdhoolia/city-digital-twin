# Point-to-point (taxi + rideshare) mode — evidence dossier and task definition

> **FROZEN DOSSIER — taxi is a physical mode with a finite fleet (DECISIONS.md §9.86, §9.99).** Current position: [`positions/taxi-and-rideshare.md`](../../positions/taxi-and-rideshare.md).

*18 August 2026. The "no separate taxi/rideshare mode" decision (STATUS declined
table; DECISIONS.md) was **re-opened by recorded decision on 18 Aug 2026 on new
evidence**: IPART now surveys Newcastle and Hunter as its own point-to-point
region, and the passenger service levy means every p2p trip in NSW is counted.
Recorded direction: infer inputs from open sources (labelled, swept), do not lodge
data requests. The formal DECISIONS.md entry is written when the mode is built.*

**Nothing below is observed for this study area unless marked measured. Every
inferred value carries its band and enters the registry with a sweep.**

## What open sources give

| Quantity | Value | Grade | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Taxi fleet, greater Newcastle | ~175 vehicles (13cabs, the largest Hunter provider); 6,164 licences state-wide | literature | 13cabs company statements; TfNSW taxi licensing review, Mar 2026 |
| Rideshare fleet | unpublished anywhere | — | would be assumed + swept (fleet size barely matters for a teleported mode) |
| Taxi fares (urban max, from 1 Jul 2025) | flagfall **$5.00**; **$2.52/km** first 12 km then $2.29/km; night $3.00/$2.73; peak surcharge $2.56; waiting $1.092/min; levy $1.32 *(corrected 25 Aug 2026 against the archived order - this row first said $5.17/$2.61, values not in the instrument; archived at `data/raw/p2p/` with provenance. Clause 2(g)(ii) names the Newcastle Transport District an **Urban** Area explicitly.)* | **measured** | TfNSW Point to Point Transport (Fares) Order 2025 |
| Rideshare fares, Newcastle | base ~$1.80–2.10; ~$1.40–1.60/km; per-minute and booking fee unresolved; surge unknowable | literature | aggregator estimates; sweep wide |
| P2P use incidence, state-wide 2025 | 48% used rideshare, 39% taxi in past 6 months; taxis ahead of rideshare in regional areas; Newcastle rideshare grew ~18%/yr (2018 survey) | literature | IPART annual p2p survey 2025 (Newcastle & Hunter regional table in the full paper — PDF fetch timed out, extract on next pass) |

## Derived volume constraint (inference, wide band)

Study-area adults ≈ 490k. If 40–50% use p2p within 6 months and active users
average 2–4 trips/month (state-pattern assumption, NOT yet confirmed for the
region), daily p2p trips ≈ **10,000–35,000**, i.e. **~0.5–1.5% of the 2.3M
daily trips** — consistent with fitting inside the HTS "Other" bucket (3.2%
incl. motorcycles). This band is the placeholder **constraint** until the IPART
regional table tightens it. The levy trip counts remain the gold source if ever
requested.

## How the mode enters (when built)

- **Teleported priced mode** — car-like travel time, fare disutility from the
  measured taxi schedule / literature rideshare rates, no parking charge. No
  fleet simulation (a DRT contrib is a §14 toolchain change, unjustified at ~1%
  of trips).
- Every value declared in `cities/newcastle/registry/` with provenance grade and
  sweep; regenerate the reference docs; `check_hardcoding --strict` stays 0.
- Validated against the derived volume band as a **constraint, never a target**
  — the pre-registered 67/143 split cannot grow.
- **Sequenced after the calibrated base (task 4.4)**: a ~1% refinement must not
  precede the measured 10–20 pp defects (ride, walk, counts). Its later
  relevance is real: p2p competes with the light rail for exactly the short CBD
  and night-time trips the footfall hypotheses examine.
