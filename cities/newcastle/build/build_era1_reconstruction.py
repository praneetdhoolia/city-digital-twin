"""Reconstruct the pre-December-2014 heavy rail service to Newcastle station.

The TfNSW historical GTFS archive begins in August 2016, by which time the line
had already been truncated. There is therefore no archived feed for the era the
proposal calls 'pre-Dec 2014', and Appendix C anticipates this: historic
timetables may exist only as PDFs, and manual reconstruction must be budgeted.

This script produces a defensible reconstruction rather than a fabrication:
it takes the earliest archived feed (August 2016, the 2015-Jul 2017 era) and
restores the three closed stations - Wickham, Civic and Newcastle - onto the
services that terminate at the truncation point, using running times derived
from the alignment length at heavy rail line speed.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not the 2014 timetable. Frequency, stopping pattern and
rolling stock are those of 2016. Validating it against a 2014 public timetable
remains an outstanding data task, recorded in DECISIONS.md.
