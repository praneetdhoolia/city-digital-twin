"""Generate the GTFS variant for every scenario in the matrix (proposal 4.3).

All scenarios share the same land use, population, behavioural parameters and
non-CBD bus network. Only the central-city trunk mode changes. This script
derives each variant from the base 2026 feed so that identity is guaranteed by
construction rather than by hand-editing.

    S0   heavy rail retained through Wickham to Newcastle station, no LR
    S1   bus shuttle from Wickham, no LR (the December 2012 policy as announced)
    S2   light rail as built                                        (= base2026)
    S2a  light rail, charging dwell removed
    S2b  light rail with full transit signal priority
    S2c  light rail on the Option A alignment (former railway land)
    S3   bus rapid transit on the same alignment
    S4   light rail extended to Broadmeadow
    S5   light rail extended to Broadmeadow and John Hunter Hospital
    S6   no trunk mode; walk, cycle and local bus only

Run-time changes are applied through the same kinematic + dwell + signal-delay
decomposition used in build_corridor_layers.py, so a scenario's run time is a
consequence of its stated physical differences, not a free parameter.
