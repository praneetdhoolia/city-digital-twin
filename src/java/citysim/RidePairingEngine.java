/**
 * Tier 1 of the ride pairing: a car passenger NAMES a household driver, and
 * takes that driver's realised travel time instead of their own routed one.
 *
 * <h2>Why a lookup and not joint plans</h2>
 *
 * <p>What makes boarding a bus cheap in MATSim is that the timetable is fixed
 * before routing, so the passenger does a lookup rather than a search. A
 * household car can work the same way: a passenger leg only ever needs to NAME
 * a driver, and the candidate set is the household — never more than nine
 * people, ~1.5 licensed adults on average. A full socnetsim joint-plans
 * implementation was built against this scenario and measured at roughly ten
 * times the cost of the whole mobsim, all of it inside
 * {@code CourtesyEventsGenerator}'s joint-ACTIVITY machinery, which answers a
 * different research question. It was reverted by owner instruction; this class
 * is what replaced it (DECISIONS.md 9.44).
 *
 * <h2>Where the pairing happens, and why that is sound</h2>
 *
 * <p>MATSim's loop is {@code replan -> all plans final -> mobsim}. At
 * {@link BeforeMobsimListener} every selected plan is stable and nothing will
 * move until the mobsim runs. THAT is our timetable. A pairing made there is
 * valid for that iteration and re-made the next, exactly as a public-transport
 * connection is re-found on every re-route.
 *
 * <p>This dissolves the objection that sent the previous attempt to socnetsim: a
 * pairing baked into PLANS is destroyed by {@code SubtourModeChoice}, which
 * carries `ride` in its mode list; a pairing made AFTER replanning is not.
 *
 * <h2>How a passenger takes the driver's time without a mobsim change</h2>
 *
 * <p>`ride` is in {@code routing.networkModes} but is not the qsim
 * {@code mainMode}, so MATSim routes it over the network and then TELEPORTS it.
 * {@code DefaultTeleportationEngine.handleDeparture} asks the agent for
 * {@code getExpectedTravelTime()}, which is
 * {@code TimeInterpretation.decideOnLegTravelTime(leg)}, which is exactly
 * {@code route.getTravelTime().or(leg.getTravelTime())} — verified against the
 * pinned jar's bytecode, not assumed from the API.
 *
 * <p>The ROUTE's time therefore wins, and both routing modules
 * ({@code NetworkRoutingModule}, {@code NetworkRoutingInclAccessEgressModule})
 * set the leg's and the route's time TOGETHER. So this class writes only the
 * ROUTE's time and never the leg's. That single choice buys three things at
 * once and needs no bookkeeping of its own:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the router's own estimate survives untouched in
 *       {@code leg.getTravelTime()}, so it is the baseline;</li>
 *   <li>an UNPAIRED leg is restored to exactly that baseline, which is the
 *       guarantee that an unpaired leg behaves exactly as it does today;</li>
 *   <li>the baseline refreshes itself whenever the router re-routes the leg,
 *       and survives the plan-copying that replanning does, because it lives in
 *       the plan rather than in a side map.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note what this deliberately does NOT do. It does not put a passenger
 * vehicle in the mobsim: a passenger travels in a car that is already there, so
 * a second vehicle would double-count the traffic. It does not move the
 * passenger's departure time, which would cascade through the rest of that
 * person's day; the pairing window is a tolerance, and the sub-window
 * adjustment is a STATED limitation. Binding the passenger physically into the
 * vehicle, with seats constraining flow, is Tier 2 and an increment on this,
 * not a prerequisite for it.
 *
 * <h2>The driver's realised time</h2>
 *
 * <p>Realised means realised in the mobsim, which is where the sample-dependent
 * queueing lives that a teleported passenger is structurally immune to — the
 * mechanism behind the fraction-dependent car/ride margin the convergence
 * pilots flagged and could not explain. It is necessarily the PREVIOUS
 * iteration's realisation, because at BeforeMobsim the current one has not
 * happened; that is the same one-iteration lag every travel time in MATSim
 * carries. Before the first mobsim, and for a driver leg with no realised
 * counterpart, the driver's own routed time is used instead and the fallback is
 * counted in the diagnostic.
 *
 * <h2>What it reports, and why the report is the point</h2>
 *
 * <p>The unpaired share, SPLIT BY DIRECTION, is written every iteration to
 * {@code ride_pairing.csv}. Return trips pair INDEPENDENTLY of outbound ones —
 * `ride` is correctly not a chain-based mode, a passenger owns no vehicle to
 * bring home, and forcing symmetry would MANUFACTURE car trips, which is the
 * direction of error this project is most exposed to. The obligation that
 * creates is to report the asymmetry rather than to remove it: a large unpaired
 * share is a finding about the DEMAND, not about this class.
