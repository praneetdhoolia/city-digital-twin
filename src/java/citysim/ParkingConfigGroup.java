/**
 * The `parking` config module: what a car is charged to stand still.
 *
 * <p>Every value here is written by {@code build_matsim_run_inputs.py} from
 * {@code config/registry/<city>/A_supply.json}. None of them may be typed into
 * a script, and none is a place: the price of a <em>link</em> is looked up in
 * {@link #getPriceFile()}, which the build produces by joining the run network
 * to the city's own job-density surface. Java does no spatial work at all.
 *
 * <p>Declaring this as a real {@link ReflectiveConfigGroup} rather than letting
 * MATSim absorb an unknown module has two consequences worth having: an
 * unrecognised parameter fails the run instead of being silently ignored, and
 * the module is written into the output config dump, so a result carries the
 * parking regime that produced it.
 *
 * <p>See DECISIONS.md 9.31 and issue #33.
