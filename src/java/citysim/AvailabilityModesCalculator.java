/**
 * Per-person mode availability, from attributes the plans builder derives or
 * declares. Successor to {@code RideAvailabilityModesCalculator}, which handled
 * `ride` alone.
 *
 * <p><b>`rideAvail`</b> (derived): MATSim's standard treatment lets any agent
 * become a car passenger on any trip. DECISIONS.md 9.7 and 9.10 measure what
 * that costs here: `ride` reaches 0.72 of legs against an observed 0.206,
 * putting 5.9 people in every car. A person may ride only if their B1 household
 * holds a vehicle AND contains another licence holder.
 *
 * <p><b>`bikeAvail`</b> (assumed, {@code B.population.bike_available_rate},
 * swept): until this existed, car was the only mode whose ownership was
 * modelled while bike was silently available to everyone — a structural bias
 * against car in the choice set itself, undeclared anywhere (issue #29,
 * DECISIONS.md 9.39).
 *
 * <p><b>`lockedMode`</b> (declared per agent tier): an agent whose demand is
 * anchored on an observed quantity of a specific mode — a through-traffic
 * vehicle seeded from a cordon road count (issue #20, DECISIONS.md 9.41) — must
 * not be handed a different mode by replanning, or the anchoring quantity
 * silently leaks. For such an agent the permissible set is the locked mode
 * alone.
 *
 * <p>Core MATSim can restrict `car` per person, through the `carAvail`
 * attribute honoured by {@link PermissibleModesCalculatorImpl}, but has no
 * equivalent for the others, and `subtourModeChoice.modes` is global. Absent
 * attributes mean available, so this class is inert on a population that does
 * not carry them.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does not do.</b> It makes a mode available or not for a
 * person. It does NOT bind a passenger to a specific driver on a specific trip
 * at a specific time, so the model can still produce more passengers than there
 * are drivers to carry them at any given hour. That is what the socnetsim joint
 * plans contrib does (Dubernet and Axhausen), which is absent from the pinned
 * jar and out of scope. The residual is stated rather than hidden (issue #31).
