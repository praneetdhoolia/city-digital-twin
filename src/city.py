"""Where one city's inputs live, and the only module that knows.

`config/schema/` is portable - what any city must supply and what shape it must
be in. `cities/<city>/` is one instance of it: that city's registry values, its
scenario/day/run overlays, its acquisition adapters, and every byte of data,
network, schedule, demand and scenario artefact derived from them.

The split is not cosmetic. Before it, 338 path literals across 46 framework
scripts named `data/`, `networks/`, `schedules/`, `demand/`, `scenarios/` and
`params/` as though a repository could only ever hold one city - and the OSM
harvest box in the extract layer clipped 87 of 1,500 core SA1s out of the road
network for three phases precisely because a typed-in constant cannot be wrong
in a way anyone notices. A second city inheriting those literals inherits the
same class of defect.

    import city
    city.path('data/processed/network/A1_road_edges.csv')

Paths returned are ABSOLUTE, so a script works from any working directory. The
argument stays city-relative, which is deliberate: it is exactly the path
recorded in that city's `data/MANIFEST.csv`, so the manifest describes a city
rather than repeating the city's own name on all 376 of its rows.

The city is selected by `CITYSIM_CITY` (default `newcastle`) - the same
selector the registry resolver uses, and an environment prefix that is itself a
suburb name awaiting rename.
