"""Build GTFS shape geometry for scenario feeds from observed network geometry.

Why this exists
---------------
The P1 scenario feeds added or moved stops without ever extending the tram's
GTFS shape, so S0, S2c, S4 and S5 all carried the same 275-point as-built
2.7 km geometry (DECISIONS.md 3.4). A stop that hangs off the end of a shape
gets mapped by pt2matsim onto whatever link happens to be nearest, which for
the extensions means the as-built corridor and for S2c means the on-street
Hunter/Scott alignment the scenario exists to avoid.

Rather than digitise an alignment by hand, every shape here is routed over
geometry the package already observes:

    road corridor   Dijkstra over the A1 road edges, with the streets named in
                    the published corridor description weighted down so the
                    route follows them and bridges any gap between them.
    reserved rail   the retained harbour-side corridor, observed in OSM where
                    it survives and interpolated across the redeveloped gap.

The stop *sitings* remain assumed - that does not change. What changes is that
the geometry joining them is now observed street centreline instead of absent.

Determinism: adjacency lists are sorted by edge id, the priority queue breaks
ties on node id, and no dict iteration order reaches a result. Repeat runs
produce byte-identical output.
