"""Layer B2 - tour-based activity chains for the synthetic population.

Replaces the activity-generation half of `build_population.py`. B1 (persons and
households) is reused unchanged; only the chains are rebuilt.

Why rebuild
-----------
The P1 chains were a list of activities in random order, joined end to end and
closed with one trip home. Measured on the delivered file:

  * every non-home destination sat on one of 1,481 zone centroids, and a single
    centroid absorbed 158,431 of 1,452,065 activity legs;
  * 684,125 legs (47%) carried a home-based purpose but did not start at home;
  * all 568,631 closing legs were labelled NHB, so 70% of "NHB" was going home;
  * every person's day was one home-to-home loop, which gives MATSim exactly one
    subtour per agent and makes chain-based mode choice all-or-nothing;
  * 1.8% of arrivals fell after the end of the day, the latest at 36.0 h;
  * there was one generic day, though the schedules carry WEEKDAY/SAT/SUN.

What this builds instead
------------------------
A day is a sequence of home-anchored **tours**. Each tour leaves home, reaches a
primary activity, optionally makes intermediate stops, and returns home. Trip
purpose follows the standard four-step convention - a home-based leg carries its
tour's purpose in either direction, and only genuinely non-home-based legs are
NHB - so the return trip from work is HW, not NHB.

Destinations are placed **inside** the zone on an observed point of attraction
where one exists (23,697 D1 POIs, 10,796 CBD building footprints), and only fall
back to a jittered point where a zone has neither. 79.3% of core zones have at
least one POI.

Three day types are produced. The HTS tables carry no day-of-week dimension, so
the day-type profile is **assumed and swept**; its *level* is not free - the
weekday/Saturday/Sunday rates are rescaled so the week average reproduces the
observed HTS trip rate exactly.

Determinism: one seeded generator, persons visited in sorted id order, zone and
POI arrays built in sorted order. Same seed reproduces the file byte for byte.

# HX is `serve passenger`: a tour made in order to carry someone else, which the

#
# NHB is NOT here, and no longer is. It is a *leg* label, not a tour purpose: a

# mapped to it, so with that moved to HX nothing observed maps to NHB at all,
# and it has no journey distance to calibrate against. Carrying it here built an
# attractor index and solved a decay that nothing then drew from.

    DECISIONS.md 9.84, the third binder pass (after 9.46 escorts and 9.60
    lifts), on the closed day file. 9.83 located the residual ride gap as a
    DEMAND CEILING: every generated trip travelled alone (party_size = 1),
    so no mode-choice or pairing repair could reach the observed 20.6%
    vehicle-passenger share - the demand for shared car travel was never
    generated. This pass creates it from what the file already holds: a
    companion's own drawn tour of a shareable purpose (declared, swept) is
    re-aimed to a household co-member's tour of a shareable purpose - the
    two travel together, so the companion's rows become a mirror of the
    driver's (same endpoints, same times, party_size 2 on both sides).

    ADDS NO TRIP and no tour: the companion's trip count is unchanged, one
    activity is relocated to be done jointly. The volume is anchored on two
    observed quantities and one identity - the HTS Vehicle-driver share,
    the measured occupancy constraint (B.activity.joint_tour_passenger_ratio
    = occupancy - 1, derived), and the escort/lift-covered trips already
    generated counting toward the target FIRST. The binding is an
    ELIGIBILITY: build_matsim_plans seeds the companion tour as ride and
    the driver tour as car, and ChangeExpBeta keeps or abandons the state
    like any other plan. Nothing here fits the scored mode share - the
    realised share stays emergent from choice and physical pairing.

    Deterministic: sorted traversal; the thinning to the target count draws
    from a rng seeded on (seed, day). A re-aimed tour that would collide
    with the companion's other tours is SKIPPED and the original kept - a
    binding must never break a day that already works (the #65 invariant).

    Writes `B2_joint_bindings_<day>.csv` beside the trips file, consumed by
    build_matsim_plans.py for mode seeding.

    Every one of the 201 external SA1s lies OUTSIDE the five-LGA study area - a
    median of 21.3 km beyond the boundary and up to 128.7 km - while the road
    network is clipped to the study area. Placing a trip end at an external zone
    centroid therefore places it where no modelled road exists, and MATSim's
    `accessEgressModeToLink` then walks the agent to the edge of the network:
    a median 2.7 km against the core population's 0.097 km, and 16-50 km in the
    top three deciles. At 1.05 m/s that is most of a day, so 48% of external car
    tours never completed and the modes that are teleported door to door - bike
    and walk, which are charged no access leg at all - won on score. That is the
    whole of the 96 km bicycle result (DECISIONS.md 9.14, 9.15).

    The standard treatment is an external station: boundary demand enters at the
    point where its corridor crosses the cordon, on a real link, and the journey
    outside the study area is simply not modelled. The cordon set is derived, not
    listed: a node is an external station if it is the nearest node on a road
    capable of carrying boundary demand to at least one external zone, which by
    construction puts it on the outward-facing edge of the network. Testing
    distance to the study-area boundary instead would pick up the coastline,

    A gate is a road edge of a cordon-capable class with one endpoint inside
    the dissolved study boundary and the other at least THROUGH_OUTSIDE_MIN_M

    (Hannell Street's river crossing is the measured false positive). Its
    volume comes from the nearest CALIBRATION count station on the SAME NAMED
    road within THROUGH_CORRIDOR_KM: only one boundary corridor has a station
    at the crossing itself (the M1 at Wyee, 273 m), the rest are measured
    16-24 km inside, and the name is what carries the corridor identity.

    Reads ONLY split == 'calibration' rows - the filter is structural, ahead of
    any use, so no holdout row can seed demand. Crossings of the same named
    road within THROUGH_CORRIDOR_KM of each other collapse to the
    highest-volume one (two carriageways are one corridor).

    Returns a list of dicts: x, y (city CRS, the inside endpoint), volume

    A BACKGROUND LOAD, declared as such (DECISIONS.md 9.49): the volume is
    B.freight.trip_ratio x the observed car-driver share of the day's
    generated core person trips, re-shaped from the person day-of-week curve
    to freight's own MEASURED one - the person-trip base already carries the
    person weekend drop, so it is divided out before the freight factor is
    applied, or the weekend would be dropped twice. One agent is one one-way
    trip, like the through tier: no local observation supports a tour
    structure, and inventing depots would be structure pretending to be
    rigour. Origins draw on the freight attractor; destinations draw on the
    same attractor under the declared distance decay. Departures take the
