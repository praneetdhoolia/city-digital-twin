"""Measure, from Newcastle data, three factors P3 previously assumed.

Writes `params/C2_network_factors.json`, which `build_activity_chains.py`
consumes. Each factor here was a typed-in constant until this script existed;
each is now derived from an observed layer already in the package, and the ones
that still cannot be observed say so and keep a sweep range instead.

  detour_factor          the straight-line to network-distance ratio, routed
                         over the observed A1 road graph. Used to compare the
                         gravity model against HTS *journey* distances, which
                         are network distances. Previously assumed 1.30.

  day_type_rate_shape    weekday vs weekend travel, from the observed RMS
                         traffic counts, which publish WEEKDAYS and WEEKENDS
                         periods per station-year. Previously assumed outright.
                         Note what this can and cannot settle: the counts
                         separate weekday from weekend but **not Saturday from
                         Sunday**, so the split within the weekend stays
                         assumed and swept.

  work_attendance        share of employed persons who travelled to work,
                         from census G62. Used only as the **lower bound** of
                         the P_MANDATORY sweep, never as the value - census
                         night was August 2021 and 19.2% worked from home, so
                         the figure carries the lockdown with it (DECISIONS.md
                         2.4 already rules G62 out as a behavioural rate).

Determinism: the routing sample is drawn from one seeded generator over zones
in sorted order, so the measured factor is reproducible.

    they are different networks AND different trip lengths, and circuity falls
    with distance, so a factor measured over multi-kilometre zone pairs is the
    wrong number for a 700 m walk.

    Sampling is at the observed trip length for the mode, between the kind of
    endpoints the model actually uses: an origin is drawn from the
    population-weighted core zones, and the destination is an observed **POI**
    lying at roughly `target_m` from it. Drawing a random bearing instead was
    tried first and rejected - it sends walk trips to points nobody walks to,
    across the harbour and the motorway, and the resulting ratio is a property
    of those barriers rather than of walking. It measured 1.96 for walk against
    a median of 1.52, the gap being the tail of destinations with no walkable
