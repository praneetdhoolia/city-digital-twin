"""Layer C1 - behavioural parameter sets, with sweep ranges.

Proposal section 6.1: "This layer decides the answer." Every row therefore
carries `source` and an explicit sweep range, and every row with
source='assumed' is mirrored in DECISIONS.md.

beta_transfer_penalty_min is the parameter the whole policy question turns on
(proposal 6.2): a five-minute-equivalent penalty produces a broadly favourable
result for the light rail, a twelve-minute penalty produces a net disbenefit for
external origins. It is never reported as a point estimate - the sweep grid
below is mandatory for every headline finding.

Money values are 2026 AUD. Base values follow the ATAP PV2 / TfNSW Economic
Parameter Values conventions; they are marked source='literature' where taken
from published guidance and source='assumed' where chosen by judgement.
