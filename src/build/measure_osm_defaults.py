"""Measure, from the observed OSM tags, the defaults applied where OSM is silent.

`build_network_layers.py` fills an untagged edge from a per-class default, and
those defaults were **assumed** - a class-level convention, not a Newcastle
measurement. That matters more than it looks, because the imputation is not a
rounding error:

    lane_width_m       42,747 of 43,112 road edges   99.2%
    num_lanes          32,499 of 43,112              75.4%
    speed_limit_kmh    23,151 of 43,112              53.7%
    footway width_m    35,074 of 35,653              98.4%

But the complement is real data: 10,613 edges DO carry a `lanes` tag and 19,961
carry `maxspeed`. A default derived from the observed distribution of the same
class in the same city is a measurement; a default typed from convention is a
guess, and P4 deliverable 0b (#23) is about telling those apart.

What this does NOT do is invent coverage. A class with no observation keeps its
assumed value and says so, and `capacity_veh_hr_lane` is not measured at all:
saturation flow is an engineering convention that OSM does not record and this
package has no count data to estimate per class. It stays assumed and swept.

The sweep for each measured default is the observed interquartile range of that
class - an observed spread, not an interval anyone chose. Where a class has too
few observations for an IQR to mean anything, it keeps its assumed value.

Determinism: no sampling; every figure is a quantile over the full tag set.
