"""Fit statistics against the CALIBRATION targets, and only those.

Proposal §8 deliverable 3 asks for *"fit statistics against all validation
targets, with honest reporting of where fit is poor"*. This computes the
calibration half. It is built so that the holdout half cannot be reached from
here: `load_targets()` filters `split == 'calibration'` at read time and raises
if anything else survives, so a holdout value is never in memory, never in an
intermediate, and never in the output.

**A modelled zero is scored, not dropped.** Where the model routes no traffic
over a link that carries observed volume, that is a *result* and the worst one
in the set - the M1 Pacific Motorway at Wyee is observed 48,016 and modelled 0.
Dropping it would flatter every aggregate below by removing the stations where
the model fails hardest, which is the inversion of proposal §8 deliverable 3.
Only a station that resolves to no link at all is unscorable, and the two cases
carry different reasons (issue 19).

**It reports what it could not score, as loudly as what it could.** A target with
no modelled counterpart is listed as `unscorable` with the reason, because
"fits 67 targets" is a much stronger claim than this data supports and
DECISIONS.md §12.1 sets out why: 13 of the 67 identify nothing in MATSim, several
are duplicates or schedule inputs, and only the 2024/25 mode-share vintage
applies to a 2026 base. The effective independent information is roughly four
mode-share degrees of freedom, one contemporary patronage level and 34 counts.

Every fit statistic carries the list of target ids it was computed over. A
statistic that does not name its targets is not reportable.
