"""Observed constraints the calibration must reproduce, derived from the HTS.

MATSim's `ride` is an unconstrained mode. It occupies no vehicle, requires no
driver to exist, consumes no road capacity, and - once the double charge is
removed (DECISIONS.md 9.8) - costs nothing per kilometre. Nothing in the
simulation stops every agent becoming a car passenger at once, and measured over
250 iterations nothing did: the model settled at a ride:car leg ratio of 4.52,
an implied **5.52 people per car**.

A car has about five seats and Newcastle's observed occupancy is 1.35, so that
outcome is not merely a poor fit, it is physically impossible. This script
derives the constraint from the only place it can be observed - the HTS vehicle
driver and vehicle passenger trip counts - so that the value the calibration
targets is measured rather than chosen.

    occupancy   = (driver trips + passenger trips) / driver trips
    passengers  = passenger trips / driver trips

Both are pure ratios of two published counts. Neither is a modelling choice, and
the sweep range is the observed spread across every survey year in the file
rather than an interval anyone picked.

**Trip length and duration by mode.** The same HTS table carries
`TRIP_AVG_DISTANCE` and `TRIP_AVG_TIME` per mode, and until now nothing used
them. They are the observable that tells whether a mode is being used over the
right RANGE, independently of how many people use it, and they are what would
have caught DECISIONS.md 9.8: `car` is the only mode carrying a distance cost
and the only mode whose modelled trip length is right, while `ride` - charged
nothing per kilometre - runs 41% too long (DECISIONS.md 9.13).

These are CONSTRAINTS, not validation targets. The 67/143 split is
pre-registered and nothing here is added to it; they are reported beside the fit
exactly as vehicle occupancy is, and are never counted into a fit statistic.
