"""P4 deliverable 6: the calibration report.

Proposal §8 deliverable 3 asks for *"fit statistics against all validation
targets, with honest reporting of where fit is poor"*. This writes that report
from one or more `_fit.json` files. It computes nothing new: every number here
was produced by `fit.py`, which reads the calibration half and cannot reach the
holdout. The report's job is to say what the numbers mean and, more importantly,
what they do not.

**It leads with what the fit cannot do.** A report that opens with a headline
error invites the reader to treat it as a score. This one opens with how many
targets were scored, how many could not be, and how much independent information
the scored ones actually carry - DECISIONS.md §12.1 puts it at roughly four
mode-share degrees of freedom, one patronage level and the counts.

**It reports constraints separately from targets, and never mixes them.** The
C4 occupancy and trip-length constraints are observables the model is checked
against but never fitted to. Presenting them beside the targets would let a
reader count them as evidence of fit; they are evidence of plausibility.

**It states which parameters moved and which could not.** A calibrated base
whose provenance is not stated is not reportable.
