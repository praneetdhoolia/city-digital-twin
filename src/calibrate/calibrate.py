"""P4 deliverable 4: the calibration loop.

Deterministic, resumable, and structurally unable to read a holdout row.

**It cannot see the holdout.** This module never opens the validation targets. It
calls `run_matsim` and `extract_metrics`, then `fit`, and reads the `_fit.json`
that `fit` wrote - and `fit` filters to `split == 'calibration'` at read time and
raises if anything else survives. As a second, independent check the loop asserts
that every target id appearing in a fit block is in the calibration set *as
reported by fit itself*, so a leak would have to defeat both.

**It cannot move a parameter it is not allowed to move.** The search space is
derived from the registry, not listed here: a field is free only if it is
`assumed`, carries a numeric sweep interval, and is NOT `held_fixed`. The six
fields held fixed under DECISIONS.md 8.5 - the mode constants - are therefore
unreachable from this loop by construction, which is the whole point of 8.5.
Proposal 9 names ASC absorption as the primary threat to validity.

**It refuses to fit more parameters than the data identifies.** The objective
contains four independent numbers (five HTS mode shares that sum to one). A
search over more free parameters than that is not a calibration, and the loop
exits rather than producing one.

**It does not calibrate against traffic counts.** DECISIONS.md 9.14 and 9.15:
the external tier carries no through traffic, so every boundary-adjacent count is
biased low by construction and tuning the core network against them would be
compensating for absent demand. Counts are still scored and reported on every
run - they are simply not optimised against. `CAL.objective.include_counts`
holds the rule and the loop enforces it.

**Constraints are constraints, not targets.** The occupancy and trip-length
constraints (C4) never enter the objective; a candidate that violates one is
marked infeasible and reported. Adding an observable to the objective would make
it a target, and the 67/143 split is pre-registered.
