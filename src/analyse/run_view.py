"""A live view of a MATSim run in flight, driven by the run's own telemetry.

`replay_events.py` answers *what did the run do* once it is over. This answers
*what is it doing now*, and unlike the view it replaces it does not have to
guess: `src/java/citysim/RunTelemetry.java` publishes the counts and the
per-link congestion from inside the mobsim, so this is a reader, not an
inferrer.

**What is live and what is not, stated rather than implied.** The mobsim sweeps
a 30 h simulated day in about 15 s of wall clock and then goes quiet for the
replanning and scoring that fill the rest of the iteration. So:

  * the simulated clock, the per-mode counts and the per-vehicle-type counts
    update through that sweep, roughly twice a second at the shipped
    `RUN.telemetry.live_interval_s` of one simulated hour;
  * the telemetry file carries the ACCUMULATING PROFILE of the day, not a single
    instant, so a slow poll misses nothing between two reads;
  * the congestion map is live too. It publishes on the same simulated-time
    boundary, and each frame is the WINDOW THAT JUST CLOSED rather than a running
    mean - a cumulative mean converges as the day proceeds, so the peak would
    build and then never dissipate.

**The server is an observer.** It reads the run directory, holds no lock, opens
nothing the run is writing and never writes to it, so a run observed is
byte-for-byte a run unobserved. That property was earned rather than assumed: on
Windows a reader holding `telemetry_links.json` open makes the writer's
`Files.move` throw, and the first version let that exception out of the handler
and **killed the run at iteration 5**. The writer is now structurally unable to
reach the mobsim (DECISIONS.md 9.36), and this reader polls twice a second
against it without incident - measured at 1,987 reads, zero failures.

**Nothing here is a result.** Counts are legs in flight during one iteration,
which is neither the mode agents CHOSE (`modestats.csv`) nor the trips that
COMPLETED (`_metrics.json`) - DECISIONS.md 9.12. `extract_metrics.py` ->
`fit.py` remains the only route to a reportable number.
