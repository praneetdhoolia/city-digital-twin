"""Map each traffic count station to the network links it counts.

A count target is a **two-way daily total at a point** (DECISIONS.md 12.2). To
compare it with the model, that point has to be resolved to the links carrying
the road there - both directions, since the count is `PRESCRIBED AND COUNTER`.

The match is made on **road name plus proximity**, and never on proximity alone
where a name is available:

  * project the station to EPSG:28356 and take every car link whose midpoint is
    within the search radius;
  * if the station's `road_name` matches a link's `name`, keep only the matching
    links - a station on the Pacific Highway must not be matched to the service
    road beside it;
  * keep the nearest link per direction, identified by the from/to node pair, so
    a divided road contributes both carriageways and a two-way single
    carriageway contributes once.

Every station carries how it was matched and how far away the link was, so a
weak match is visible in the fit rather than hidden inside it. Stations that
cannot be matched are written out as unmatched rather than silently dropped:
a count target with no link is a target the model cannot be scored against, and
that has to be stated.

This reads the station coordinates and the network. **It does not read a
validation target value**, so it is indifferent to the calibration/holdout split
and maps all 119 stations alike.
