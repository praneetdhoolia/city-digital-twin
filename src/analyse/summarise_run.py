"""Close out a completed run: what it did, and whether it can be believed.

A finished run used to leave a log, a directory of scratch and three JSON files,
and the question *"so what happened?"* was answered by reading them. This writes
the answer down, in both dialects: `_summary.json` against a declared schema for
anything downstream, and `SUMMARY.md` for a person.

**It answers three questions and refuses a fourth.**

  1. *What was run?* Scenario, day type, sample fraction, seed, iteration count,
     thread count and the controler hash. A reading can never be separated from
     the run that produced it, and at 1% it cannot be compared with 10% at all
     (DECISIONS.md 9.12).
  2. *Did it relax?* After MATSim disables innovation no new plans are created,
     so any remaining movement in mode share is relaxation rather than search.
     That is precisely the question issue #5 turns on, and a run that has not
     settled supports no conclusion at all.
  3. *Did its own accounting close?* Every departure must end as an arrival, a
     stuck agent or an unresolved leg. A run that has lost agents is not one to
     take a number from.

The fourth question - *what does this say about Newcastle?* - is refused. There
is no mode share here, no patronage, no fit statistic and no comparison against a
validation target. Those come from `extract_metrics.py` -> `fit.py` ->
`report.py`, which is the only route to a reportable number, and the 67/143 split
is enforced inside `fit.py` rather than here. What this file carries is the
state of the RUN, not a finding about the city.

Run automatically by `run_matsim.py` when a run succeeds, and standalone on any
run directory that already holds telemetry:

    **The window does not start at the innovation cutoff, and this is the whole
    point of the function.** When innovation is disabled, exploration stops in a
    single step and selection concentrates every agent onto its best-scoring
