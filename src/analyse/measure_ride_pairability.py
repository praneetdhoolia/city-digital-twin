"""Could the `ride` demand a run produced actually be carried by anyone?

A car passenger is not a mode, it is a SEAT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR. The model may
put any number of agents in that seat; whether a driver exists to be beside is a
separate question, and until this file existed nothing asked it. `rideAvail`
(DECISIONS.md 9.10) asks a much weaker one - does this person's household hold a
vehicle and another licence holder AT ALL - which is a property of the household,
not of the hour, the place or the trip.

This reads a COMPLETED run's own `output_trips.csv.gz`, joins every traveller to
their B1 household, and asks, for each ride trip, whether another member of that
household made a car trip the passenger could plausibly have been inside. It
reports the four declared `B.ride.pairing_rule` values against a spread of
windows, so the answer is a surface rather than a point.

**It is a diagnostic, not a validation.** It reads no target, holdout or
otherwise, and it invents nothing: every quantity here is counted out of the
run's own output and the committed synthetic population. What it produces is a
property of the demand and of the sampler, and it is exactly the check the
project's standing goal asks for - whether sampling a fraction of a population
still predicts the right ridership PER MODE, checked rather than assumed.

**Its headline is negative, and that is the point.** Measured on the two
completed convergence arms (DECISIONS.md 9.44): only 0.10% of ride trips at 25%
shared an origin-destination pair with a household car trip at ANY time of day,
and 56.9% belonged to a household that made no car trip at all. See also
DECISIONS.md 9.45 for the half of that which was the sampler's doing.
