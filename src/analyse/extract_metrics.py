"""Turn a completed run into quantities comparable with the validation targets.

Three metrics, each in the units its target is published in, and each with the
translation stated rather than assumed:

**Mode share.** MATSim's `main_mode` per trip is a *linked* concept - a walk to
a bus stop is part of a pt trip - which is what the published HTS `MODE_SHARE`
measures and is why the linked Newcastle-LGA figures are the comparable ones
(DECISIONS.md 12.1). The target geography is **Newcastle LGA**, and the model
covers five, so trips are attributed to the LGA of the traveller's **home**
coordinate and the share computed over Newcastle residents alone.

**Trip length and duration by mode.** The observable that says whether a mode is
used over the right *range*, independently of how many people use it. Compared
against `TRIP_AVG_DISTANCE` and `TRIP_AVG_TIME` in the HTS, which nothing used
until DECISIONS.md 9.13. It is a CONSTRAINT, never a validation target: the
67/143 split is pre-registered and this is not part of it.

**PT boardings.** Every pt leg with a `transit_line` is one boarding, which is
what an Opal tap-on is. Legs are scaled by 1/fraction to full population. The
intervention's boardings are attributed by each boarded route's scheduled
`transportMode` against the city's declared `intervention.mode`, not by
guessing at line names.

**Link volumes.** `vol_car` from `output_links.csv`, summed over the links a
count station maps to (both directions, since the counts are two-way), scaled by
1/fraction. Two corrections from `params/C3_count_comparison.json` are applied
and reported separately, never folded in: a `ride` leg contributes **no** vehicle
because observed vehicle trips are driver trips (DECISIONS.md 9.8), and the
model carries no freight, so the observed count is compared on a light-vehicle
basis using each station's own heavy share where classified.

This module reads run outputs, the station-link map and C3. **It never opens
`validation_targets.csv`**, so it cannot see the calibration/holdout split, let
alone a holdout value. Scoring against targets is `src/calibrate/fit.py`, which
reads the calibration rows only.
