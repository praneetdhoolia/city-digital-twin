"""Run one assembled scenario x day type, deterministically and resumably.

Takes a set out of `scenarios/matsim/<S>/<DAY>/` and runs it at a sample
fraction, writing everything derived into the run directory so the committed
inputs are never modified in place. A run is identified by its own parameters,
so re-invoking with the same ones is a no-op rather than a repeat.

**The RUNNER names the run directory** (owner directive, 24 Aug 2026):
`<launch yyyymmddThhmmss>_<iterations>it_<sample percentage>pct`, e.g.
`20260821T220310_1000it_25pct`. Nobody passes a name in. The launch stamp is
a LABEL, not identity: identity stays the parameter set recorded in
`_run.json`, which is what resume detection matches on — so the wall clock in
the name cannot make two runs of the same parameters different results.

**Resumable, not restartable.** MATSim has no mid-run checkpoint, so "resume"
here means: a completed run is detected and skipped. A run that died leaves no
`_run.json` and is repeated from the start.

**Deterministic.** One seed, fixed thread count recorded in the run record
(MATSim's mobsim partitions by thread count, so it is part of the run's
identity, not a performance knob), and a nested hash-based subsample.

**It cannot read a validation target.** This module opens the scenario inputs,
the plans and the toolchain. Nothing else. The fit statistic lives in
`src/calibrate/`, and the holdout rows are never opened by either.
