"""Deterministic population subsample, with the transit fleet scaled to match.

Three properties matter and none is free.

**Whole households.** The sampling UNIT is the household, not the person
(`RUN.sample.unit`, DECISIONS.md 9.45). It was the person until then, and the
cost was invisible because nothing in the model was household-coupled: a sample
drawn per person keeps each member independently, so a household of size n
retains on average f*n of its members and the chance a given person keeps ANY
co-member is 1-(1-f)^(n-1) - about 0.14 at f=0.10 and 0.32 at f=0.25 here. Every
household mechanism was therefore being decided by the sampler, and decided
DIFFERENTLY at each fraction, which is the one thing a sample fraction must not
do. Measured on the two completed pilot arms: the share of `ride` legs whose
household drives at all was 32.6% at 10% and 43.1% at 25%. The price, stated
rather than hidden, is that a household-clustered sample carries more variance
at a given size than a person-wise one.

**Nested.** A unit is kept if a hash of its id falls below the fraction, so the
1% sample is a strict subset of the 10% sample. Three fractions are then three
views of one population rather than three independent draws, and a difference
between them is a sample-size effect rather than a sampling one. Hashing the
HOUSEHOLD id nests exactly as hashing the person id did.

**Fleet scaled with it.** MATSim enforces transit vehicle capacity at boarding,
and the fleet carries `seats` with `standingRoomInPersons=0` (Bus 70, Tram 180).
At a 10% sample an unscaled bus carries 70 sampled agents, i.e. 700 real ones,
so capacity never binds and crowding silently disappears. Seats are therefore
scaled by the same fraction, with a floor of `RUN.sample.transit_capacity_floor`
seats so no vehicle becomes unusable.

Nothing here reads a validation target, let alone a holdout one.
