"""Assert that a registry field and the constant it replaced still agree.

The build layer HAS been migrated and this check is now nearly empty, which is
the point: every migrated script reads the registry, so its duplicate constant
was deleted with the `legacy_symbol` that pinned it. What remains is whatever
still holds its own copy of a declared value. Two copies of a number is exactly
the drift this package cannot absorb, so any that survive are pinned by test
until they are migrated too.

Every field carrying `legacy_symbol: "path/to/file.py:SYMBOL"` is compared with
the literal actually assigned in that file. A mismatch is a failure, not a
warning: it means the registry documents one value and the model runs another.

This check becomes unnecessary the moment a script reads the registry instead,
and the `legacy_symbol` key is removed with the constant.

#
#   B.activity.detour_factor - the build script now reads the field as its
#     fallback, so there is no second copy to diverge from.
#   A.lightrail.dwell_charging_s - it never carried a `legacy_symbol`, so this
#     entry compared NOTHING while the handover brief told the next agent the
#     constant was pinned and should be left alone. The constant is gone: the
#     baseline sweep point comes from the reference scenario's overlay.
