This repository's signature defect is not a wrong number. It is a number in a
place nobody looks: a declared field that reaches nothing, a template literal
that shadows it, a sweep range typed beside the value it is supposed to bound.
Every instance found so far was caught by ARITHMETIC or by an audit, never by
reading the code, so the audit is committed rather than remembered.

Five questions, asked separately because the answers mean different things:

  1. UNWIRED FIELDS   a declared field whose key appears nowhere in the source
                      as a value. It cannot reach the model, whatever
                      `consumers` claims.
  2. REPORT-ONLY      a declared field read ONLY by the measurement layer. It
                      is printed back after a run; it decides nothing.
  3. TEMPLATE LITERALS a <param name=... value=...> written as a constant rather
                      than substituted. Each is a modelling choice in a builder.
  4. SCRIPT DECISIONS a value decided in code rather than declared - in any of
                      the five forms `scan_decisions` distinguishes.
  5. COORDINATES      a latitude/longitude pair typed into a script. The hard
                      constraint is absolute: a coordinate belongs in
                      `cities/<city>/geometry/` or the registry, never in code.

**What changed, and why the count moved.** The first version of this audit
asked whether a field key was a SUBSTRING of any source file. That counted a
mention in a comment, a docstring or a test assertion as reach - so
`RUN.controler.write_events_interval`, named only in a Java comment, and
`A.signals.scats_phasing`, named only in a test, both passed as wired while
deciding nothing. Worse, the count fell when someone added an explanatory
comment. A gate you can satisfy by editing prose is not a gate. A key is now
counted as reaching the model only where it appears as a COMPLETE STRING
LITERAL in non-test source - the form a key takes when it is data.

The constant scan has the same history. It looked only at module-level,
single-target, ALL-CAPS, SCALAR assignments, which is a small minority of the
forms a decision takes: it could not see `ACCEL, DECEL = 1.2, 1.3`, a table of
stop coordinates, `def make_bus_shuttle(speed_kmh=28.0)`, or
`add_argument('--iterations', default=100)` for a field the registry declares
UNOBTAINED. It now delegates to `extract_legacy_constants.scan_decisions`,
which is the repository's one AST scanner for decided values.

It reports; it does not judge. A field may legitimately be read by prefix, and a
constant may be structural. The point is that every one of them is SEEN.

City-agnostic: the city comes from `city.py`, and nothing here names a place.
